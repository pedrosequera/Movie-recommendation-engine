 Compute the top-K most similar movies given a movie title using knn.covertree's implementation of K-nearest neighbors in the R language.

The objective is to take a movie title as input and respond with the top-10 most similar movies using the MovieLens dataset 
(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens )

For this exercise weâ€™ll use the  MovieLens Latest Dataset. Which includes:
58,000 movies
27,000,000 ratings by 280,000 users
1,100,000 tag applications 
Tag genome data with 14 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags
